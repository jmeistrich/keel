package q

// A Page describes which page you want from a list of records,
// in the style of this "Connection" pattern:
// https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm
//
// Consider for example, that you previously fetched a page of 10 records
// and from that previous response you also knew that the last of those 10 records
// could be referred to with the opaque cursor "abc123". Armed with that information you can
// ask for the next page of 10 records by setting First to 10, and After to "abc123".
//
// To move backwards, you'd set the Last and Before fields instead.
//
// When you have no prior positional context you should specify First but leave Before and After to
// the empty string. This gives you the first N records.
type Page struct {
	First  int
	Last   int
	After  string
	Before string
}
